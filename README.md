# Anime Character Generation using GAN & DCGAN 🎨🤖
Welcome to the Anime Character Generation project! This repository contains a deep learning model powered by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) to generate high-quality anime characters. If you're a developer, AI enthusiast, or anime fan looking to explore AI-generated art, this project is for you!

## 🚀 About the Project
This project utilizes GANs and DCGANs to train on an extensive anime character dataset and generate new, high-quality anime images. The training process involves two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—working against each other in an adversarial setup to create realistic, high-resolution anime characters.

## ⏳ Training Time & System Requirements
⚠️ Heads up! Training this model is computationally intensive. It took 3 days and 2 nights on my system. If you have a more powerful GPU/TPU setup, you can train the model faster and improve its performance.

## 📂 Dataset & Dependencies
To replicate and improve upon this project, follow these steps:

Download the dataset

You can access an anime dataset from sources like Kaggle or manually collect a dataset of anime character images.

Example dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/melissamonfared/anime-character-generation-dsgan-gan/notebook#notebook-container

Install dependencies

Use the following command to install required libraries:


Run the Notebook

Open arun.test (4) (1).ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Train the model by executing the cells step by step.

Improve Model Performance

Modify the architecture of the Generator & Discriminator to enhance quality.

Experiment with different hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, epochs).

Utilize better hardware (GPUs/TPUs) to reduce training time.

## 🎯 Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository, train the model with your own dataset, tweak the architecture, and share your improvements! If you need the detailed report, you can contact me.

Let's push the boundaries of AI creativity and anime generation together! 🚀🎨
